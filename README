This is a filter program that will read a wav file called in.wav
at the current directory and make a filtered out.wav. This is for
university programmers, noob programmers who want to learn DSP (like me).
It uses IFFT to make a kernel and then performs convolution filtering.
It's all MIT licensed. This is fun!
